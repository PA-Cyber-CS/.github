# PA Cyber CS
PA Cyber Cs (The github org) is NOT the official PA Cyber Charter School Github Org, but this is ran by students to make websites via github pages to help PACyber. 
We will code and host a website for PA Cyber so they can use the site to host images, code, ect. We keep the slogan "By students, for Staff." (Trademark Pending)

### FOR PACYBER STAFF AND LEGAL TEAM(S)
This is hosted by a student. Please contact the email info@contentltd.net if there are any problems, questions, comments, ect.
